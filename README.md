🔐 Secure Auth Fullstack

Secure Auth Fullstack is a complete authentication & authorization system built using the MERN stack, focused on security, real-world authentication flows, and user experience.
This project is designed to reflect industry-level auth practices used in modern web applications.

It covers everything from user signup, login, OTP verification, password reset, protected routes, and profile handling, with both frontend and backend fully integrated.
